# Short Term
- IMPORTANT: loaded games should only load player data for the songs, to avoid broken URLs being stuck forever
- Samples should be guessable without errors but not counted for points
- Allow users to reset/reload days when there is an inconsistency
# Long Term
- Embed Heardle into game as a different mode
